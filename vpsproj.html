    <h1>My Work with VPS Hosting</h1>
    <p>During my time at XYZ Hosting, I had the opportunity to work extensively with Virtual Private Servers (VPS). I'm excited to share some of the highlights of my work and how I prioritized security using Path.net.</p>
    
    <h2>Enhancing VPS Security with Path.net</h2>
    <p>One of the key aspects of my role was to ensure the security of our clients' VPS environments. To achieve this, I implemented a multi-layered security approach. One of the standout tools I utilized was Path.net, a robust security framework that helped in managing access control, encryption, and monitoring of server resources.</p>
